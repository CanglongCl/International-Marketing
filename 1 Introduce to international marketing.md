## Marketing & Global Marketing Defined

Marketing: “the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large”

Marketing Mix: The 4 Ps

Global Marketing: The scope of activities outside the home market

## What is Global Marketing?

- Global versus “Regular” Marketing
  - Scope of activities are outside the home-country market

**Table 1-1 Product/Market Growth Matrix**

| Market Orientation \ Product Orientation | Existing Products | New Products |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Existing markets | Market penetration Strategy | Product development strategy |
| New markets | Market development strategy | Diversification strategy |

## Challenges for Marketers

- Marketers encounter unique or unfamiliar features in countries or regions
  - counterfeiting and piracy in China
  - Bribery and corruption
- Managers at global companies understand the importance of local excellence.

> “The best global brands are also the best local brands.” - John Quelch & Katherine Jocz
>

## Customer Perceived Value

- **The Value Chain **is composed of marketing, product design, manufacturing, and transportation logistics.
- The essence of marketing is to provide a superior **value proposition** to surpass the competition.
- Create value for customers by improving benefits or reducing price
  - Improve the product
  - Find new distribution channels
  - Create better communications
  - Cut monetary and non-monetary costs and prices

## Markets & Value Proposition

- **Market**
  - People or organizations that are both able and willing to buy
- **Value Proposition**
  - Perceived value to the customer
  - The firm’s promise to the customer

Japanese auto makers gained U.S. market share in the 1980s by creating a superior **value proposition: **Cars with higher quality, better mileage, and lower prices that those of U.S. makers.

Today’s new **value proposition: **high quality vehicles for less than \$10K or less for Indian and African markets.

## Competitive Advantage

When a company succeeds in ==creating more value for customers than its competitors== do it creates **Competitive Advantage**.

Measured relative to industry rivals

“Created when a firm has value-creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential competitors.” ~ Jay Barney

## Globalization

“Economic globalization constitutes integration of national economies into the international economy through trade, direct foreign investment (by corporations and multinationals), short-term capital flows, international flows of workers and humanity generally, and flows of technology.”

### Global Industries

An industry is global to the extent that a company’s industry position in one country is interdependent with its industry position in another country

Indicators of globalization:

- Ratio of cross-border investment to total capital investment

- Proportion of industry revenue generated by all companies that compete in key world regions

- Ratio of cross-border trade to worldwide production


### Competitive Advantage, Globalization & Global Industries

- **Focus**
  
  - Concentration and attention on core business and competence
  
    “Nestle is focused: We are food and beverages. We are not running bicycle shops. Even in food we are not in all fields. There are certain areas we do not touch…We have no soft drinks because I have said we will either buy Coca-Cola or we leave it alone. This is focus.” ~Helmut Maucher, former chairman of Nestlé S A~

### Value, Competitive Advantage, & Focus

- Value, Competitive Advantage, and Focus are universal in their relevance and guide marketing in any part of the world.

- Companies that understand and engage in global marketing can offer more value to customers that those who do not

  “Globalization is no longer an abstraction but a stark reality…Choosing not to participate in global markets is no longer an option. All firms, regardless of their size, have to craft strategies in the broader context of world markets to anticipate, respond, and adapt to the changing configuration of these markets.” - C. Samuel Craig and Susan P. Douglas

### Table 1-2 Strategic Focus

| Company/Headquarters | Divestiture/Buyer |
| :-: | :-: |
| General Electric (United States) | Appliance division, sold to Haier (China) for \$5.4 billion (2016); N B C Universal, sold to Comcast for \$30 billion (2009). |
| Vivendi (France) | Activision Blizzard videogame unit, management buyout for $8.2 billion (2013). |
| Unilever (United Kingdom/Netherlands) | American pasta sauce business, sold to Mizkan Group (Japan) for $2.15 billion (2014).  |
| IBM (United States) | Microelectronics division, sold to Global Foundries for $1.5 billion (2014). |

### Pros and Cons of Globalization

- Hundreds of million of people have been lifted from poverty and joined the middle class

- Where globalization has raised wages, living standards have improved

- Not all gains from globalization have been evenly distributed

- U.S. President Trump’s “America First” agenda is one example of nations retreating into protectionism and isolation

- “Globalization in reverse”


### Standardization versus Adaptation

- Globalization **(Standardization)**
  - Developing standardized products marketed worldwide with a standardized marketing mix
  - Essence of mass marketing
- Global localization **(Adaptation)**
  - Mixing standardization and customization in a way that minimizes costs while maximizing satisfaction
  - Essence of segmentation
  - Think globally, act locally

### Global Marketing: What It Is & What It Isn’t

![image-20220705102122947](/Users/canglong/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/课业文件/International Marketing/img/image-20220705102122947.png)

### Additional Dimensions

- **Concentration of Marketing Activities**
  - the extent to which activities related to the marketing mix (e.g., promotional campaigns or pricing decisions) are ==performed in one or a few country locations==
- **Coordination of Marketing Activities**
  - the extent to which ==marketing activities== related to the marketing mix are planned and executed ==interdependently== around the globe
- **Integration of Competitive Moves**
  - the extent to which a firm’s ==competitive marketing tactics==`策略` in different parts of the world are ==interdependent==

### Global Localization

- “Think globally, act locally”

- May be a combination of standard (product) and nonstandard approaches (distribution or packaging)

- McDonald’s in France have muted colors and golden arches are more subtle. American franchisees saw the success in France and implemented similar renovations.

- CPG companies find that products created for emerging markets with low cost and less packaging appeal to budget consumers in countries like Spain and Greece.


Table 1-5 Examples of Effective Global Marketing: McDonald’s

| Marketing Mix Element | Standardized | Localized |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Product | Big Mac | McAloo Tikka potato burger, Chicken Maharaja Mac (India); Rye McFeast (Finland); Adagio (Italy) |
| Promotion | Brand name | Slang nicknames-for example, Mickey D’s (United States, Canada), Macky D’s (United Kingdom, Ireland), Macca’s (Australia), Mäkkäri (Finland), MakDo (Philippines), McDo (France) |
|  | Advertising slogan “i’m lovin’ it” | “Venez comme vous êtes” (“Come as you are”) television ad campaign in France. Various executions show individuals expressing different aspects of their respective personalities. One features a young man dining with his father. The ad’s creative strategy centers on sexual freedom and rebellion: The father does not realize that his son is gay. |
| Place | Freestanding restaurants in high-traffic public areas | McDonald’s Switzerland operates themed dining cars on the Swiss national rail system; McDonald’s is served on the Stena Line ferry from Helsinki to Oslo; home delivery (India) |
| Price | Average price of Big Mac is $4.20 (United States) | \$6.79 (Norway); $2.44 (China) |

### The Importance of Global Marketing

For U.S. companies, 75% of total world market for goods and services is outside the country

  - Coca-Cola earns 75% of operating income and 2/3

  - of profit outside of North America

For Japanese companies, 90% of world market is outside the country

94% of market potential is outside of Germany for its companies even though it is the largest E U market

## Management Orientations`态度`

- **Ethnocentric `种族中心主义的` Orientation**
  - Home country is superior to others
  - Sees only similarities in other countries
  - Assumes products and practices that succeed at home will be successful everywhere
  - Leads to a **standardized** or **extension approach**

- **Polycentric (multiational) Orientation**
  - Each country is unique
  - Each subsidiary develops its ==own unique business and marketing strategies==
  - Often referred to as **multinational**
  - Leads to a **localized or adaptation approach** that assumes products must be adapted to local market conditions

- **Regiocentric Orientation**
  - A region is the relevant ==geographic unit==
    - Ex: The NAFTA or European Union market
  - Some companies serve markets ==throughout the world but on a regional basis==
    - Ex: General Motors had four regions for decades

- **Geocentric Orientation**
  - Entire world is a potential market
  - Strives for integrated global strategies
  - Also known as a **global or transnational company**
  - Retains an association with the headquarters country
  - Pursues serving world markets from a single country or sources globally to focus on select country markets
  - Leads to a ==combination of **extension and adaptation elements**==

## Forces Affecting Global Integration & Global Marketing

- Multilateral trade agreements

- Converging market needs and wants and the information revolution

- Transportation and communication improvements


- Product development costs

- Quality


## Driving Forces `驱动力` Affecting Global Integration and Global Marketing

- **World Economic Trends**

  - Prior to the global economic crisis in 2008, economic growth has been driven by:
    - Economic growth in key developing countries provided incentive for investment. (Growing middle class in India, China have money to spend)
    - Economic growth led policymakers to favor outsiders. (China saw that foreign firms would not threaten domestic firms.)
    - The worldwide movement toward free markets, deregulation, and privatization
- **Leverage**
  - Experience transfers
  - Scale economies
  - Resource utilization
  - Global strategy

  - Management myopia


  - Organizational culture


  - National controls


  - Opposition to globalization


# Chapter 2 The Global Economic Enviroment

## Learning Objectives

**2.1** Identify and briefly explain major changes in the world economy over the last 100 years

**2.2** Compare and contrast types of economic systems that are found in the different regions of the world

**2.3 **Explain the stages of economic development used by the World Bank and identify the key emerging country markets at each stage of development

**2.4** Discuss the significance of balance of payments for the world’s major economies

**2.5** Identify the countries that are leading exporters

**2.6** Briefly explain how exchange rates impact a company’s opportunities in different parts around the world

## The World Economy-An Overview 

- In the early 20th century economic integration was at 10%; today it is 50%
- EU and NAFTA are very integrated
- Global competitors have displaced or absorbed local ones

The new realities:
- ==Capital movements== have ==replaced trade== as the driving force of the world economy
- Production has become uncoupled from employment
- The world economy, not individual countries, is the dominating factor
- The struggle between capitalism and socialism began in 1917 is over
- E-Commerce diminishes the importance of national barriers and forces companies to re-evaluate business models

## Zeroing in on Economic Systems

- Globalization has made it harder to pigeonhole`分类` economies within the four-cell matrix

- Also consider:
  - Type of economy: advanced industrial state, emerging or transition economy, or developing nation?
  -  Type of Government: Monarchy, dictatorship, tyrant? One-party system? Dominated by another state? Democracy? Terrorist?
  - Trade and capital flows: Free trade, part of trading bloc? Currency board or exchange controls?
  - The commanding heights: Transportation, communications & energy sectors. State, private, or mixed ownership?
  - Services provided by the state or state funded: Pensions, health care, education.
  
  
  - Institutions: Country characterized by transparency, standards, absence of corruption? Standards ignored and court system compromised?
  
  
  - Markets: Entrepreneurial high risk/high reward? Socialized market? Government dominated price and wage controls?
  

Figure 2-1 Economic Systems

<img src="img/1%20Introduce%20to%20international%20marketing5.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

## Market Capitalism

- Individuals and firms allocate resources

- Production resources are privately owned

- Driven by consumers

- Government’s role is to promote competition among firms and ensure consumer protection


Table 2-1 Western Market Systems

| Type of System | Key Characteristics | Countries |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Anglo-Saxon model | Private ownership; free enterprise economy; capitalism; minimal social safety net; highly flexible<br />employment policies | United States, Canada,<br />Great Britain |
| Social market economy<br />model | Private ownership; “social partners” orientation that includes employer groups, unions, and banks; unions and corporations are involved in government, and vice versa; inflexible employment policies | Germany, France, Italy |
| Nordic model | Mix of state ownership and private ownership; high taxes; some market regulation; generous social<br />safety net | Sweden, Norway |

## Centrally Planned Socialism

Opposite of market capitalism

State holds broad powers to serve the public interest; decides what goods and services are produced and in what quantities

Consumers can spend only what is available

Government owns entire industries and controls distribution

Demand typically exceeds supply

Little reliance on product differentiation, advertising, pricing strategy

China, India, and the former U S S R now moving towards some market allocation and private ownership

- Economic system in which command resource allocation is used extensively in an environment of private resource ownership
- Example:
  - Swedish government controls 2/3 of all spending; a hybrid of C P S and capitalism (Market Socialism)
  - Swedish government plans move towards privatization

## Stages of Market Development

- The World Bank has defined four categories of development using Gross National Income (GNI) as a base

- **BEMs**, identified 10 years ago, were countries in Central Europe, Latin America, and Asia that were to have rapid economic growth
- Today, the focus is on **BRICS**: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa

## Overview of International Finance

- Foreign exchange allows companies to do business globally with different currencies

- Exchange risk occurs when the value of a currency changes as it is traded

- Spot market: immediate delivery

- Forward market: future delivery

- Currency market participants include countries’ central banks, companies that convert foreign currency into their home currencies, currency speculators

- Devaluation: the reduction of a nation’s currency against other currencies

- Mercantilism or Competitive-currency politics: Countries do not allow their currency to fluctuate

- Revaluation: a nation allows its currency to strengthen

- Foreign exchange makes it possible to do business across the boundary of a national currency

- Currency of various countries are traded for both immediate (spot) and future (forward) delivery

- Currency risk adds turbulence to global commerce


## Foreign Exchange Market Dynamics

- Supply and Demand interaction
  - Country sells more goods/services than it buys
  - There is a greater demand for the currency
  - The currency will appreciate in value

Table 2 - 8 Exchange Risks and Gains in Foreign Transactions

| Blank | \$1,000,000 Contract | \$1,000,000 Contract |  €1,100,000 Contract | €1,100,000 Contract |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Foreign Contract Exchange Rates | U.S. Seller  Receives | European Buyer Pays | U.S. Seller Receives | European Buyer Pays |
| €1.25 = \$1 | \$1,000,000 | €1,250,000 | \$880,000 | €1,100,000 |
| €1.10 = \$1 | \$1,000,000 | €1,100,000 | \$1,000,000 | €1,100,000 |
| €1.00 = \$1 | \$1,000,000 | €1,000,000 | \$1,100,000 | €1,100,000 |
| €0.85 = \$1 | \$1,000,000 | €850,000 | \$1,294,118 | €1,100,000 |

## Managing Economic Exposure

- **Economic exposure** refers to the impact of ==currency fluctuations== on the present value of the company’s financial performance.
- Occurs when sales are in a foreign currency
  - Nestlé generates 98% of sales outside home country
  - Euro zone companies GlaxoSmithKline, Daimler A G, B P, for example, generate 1/3 of sales in the U.S.

- Numerous techniques and strategies have been developed to reduce exchange rate risk
  - Hedging involves balancing the risk of loss in one currency with a corresponding gain in another currency
  - Forward Contracts set the price of the exchange rate at some point in the future to eliminate some risk
