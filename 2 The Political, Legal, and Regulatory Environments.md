## Sovereignty

**Sovereignty**`主权`: Supreme and independent political authority

“A sovereign state was considered free and independent. It regulated trade, managed the flow of people into and out of its boundaries, and exercised undivided jurisdiction over all persons and property within its territory. It had the right, authority, and ability to conduct its domestic affairs without outside interference and to use its international power and influence with full discretion.”Richard Stanley, President, Stanley Foundation

## Sovereignty & Global Market Integration

- Some believe that global market integration is eroding`侵害` national economic sovereignty
